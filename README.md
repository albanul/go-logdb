After reading Mark Kleppmann's book, "Designing Data-Intensive Applications," I felt inspired to develop my own
append-only file-based database. This database is designed to efficiently store and retrieve key-value pairs.

## Features

- [x] Store key-value data in database
- [ ] Fetch data by a key
- [ ] In-memory index
- [ ] Binary format
- [ ] Database compaction
- [ ] Delete a record
- [ ] Store index on a disk
- [ ] Index rebuild
- [ ] Partially written records
- [ ] Concurrency control
